Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP address 

is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access 

to the local hosts. Also, it does the translation of port numbers i.e. masks the port number of the 

host with another port number, in the packet that will be routed to destination. It then makes the 

corresponding entries of ip address and port number in the NAT table. NAT generally operates 

on router or firewall. The main concept is, it allows a single device to act as an Internet gateway 

for internal LAN clients by translating the clients' internal network IP Addresses into the IP 

Address on the NAT-enabled gateway device.

A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the 

internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. It is a 

server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages 

they visit online.When a computer connects to the internet, it uses an IP address. This is similar 

to your home’s street address, telling incoming data where to go and marking outgoing data with 

a return address for other devices to authenticate. A proxy server is essentially a computer on the 

internet that has an IP address of its own.

Network Address Translation (NAT) is the process that modifies the IP address in a header 

of an IP packet, while it is travelling through a routing device. NAT allows one set of IP addresses 

to be used for traffic within a LAN (Local Area Network) and another set of IP addresses for 

outside traffic. One to one transformation of IP addresses are provided by the simplest form of 

NAT. Proxy Server is a server that is located between a client (who is looking for a resource) and 

some other server and acts as a mediator. The client requesting the resource connects to the proxy 

server and the proxy evaluates the request based on its filtering rules.
